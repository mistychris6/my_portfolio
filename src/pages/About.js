      <h1>Personality and Passions</h1>
      <p>My first name really is one word...but I go by Misty</p>
      <p>I love the outdoors and am usually up for an adventure!  
         Rock climbing is my current indoor/outdoor challenge (insert my Grandma's lecture here...).  Although I'm a certified Diver, 
         I prefer land over water and typically find myself in the picture perfect moment without a camera.  I love my morning cup of 
         coffee, traveling, animals, learning new things, and especially love to joke and laugh!  On a typical weekend, you can find
         me either up in the mountains, helping with a house remodel, or doing some body work on a truck.</p>
